In general, the program is very well written.
It is short, concise and straight to the point.

The only recommendation I can do is to nest everything:
- Every function is define at the beginning of the code.
- All functions are executed in a single function which calls the others.
- Important variables are define at the beginning of the code. The rest will be manage only inside its functions.
